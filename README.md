# PyTorch Intent Classification Chatbot

A simple intent-based chatbot built with PyTorch and NLTK using a Bag-of-Words approach and a feed-forward neural network (MLP) for intent classification. This beginner-friendly project demonstrates how traditional NLP and neural networks work together.

## 🚀 Features
- Intent classification using an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- Bag-of-Words text representation
- Tokenization and lemmatization with NLTK
- Rule-based responses from `intents.json`
- Optional function execution based on predicted intent
- Model save and load support
